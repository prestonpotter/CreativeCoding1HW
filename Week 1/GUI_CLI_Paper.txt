GUI’s and CLI’s are two different ways that users can interact with a graphical interface. GUI stands for graphical user interface, while CLI stands for command line interface. In a graphical user interface, users select different graphical elements on the display in order to interact with the technology, where in a command line interface the user instead types out different commands in order to perform actions. CLI is generally used by those who are more experienced with computer systems, as it is a bit more complicated due to the fact that it requires memorization of certain commands, as opposed to the options being presented via a graphic. However, CLI offers a lot more potential for the things that you can do as you can choose more specific commands, and it doesn’t need a graphical interface in order for you to operate it. GUI is usually much more beneficial for more casual users of computer systems as it has visual feedback from actions and overall is much easier to understand as the graphics are presented to you and it removes much of the memorization aspect of computer operation. It generally does not offer as many functions as a CLI though, and requires more to run/process.
