I do think that learning styles have somewhat of an effect on how we learn. I do feel that to some degree different people have different preferences and success rates from different learning styles. The intro to that paper reminded me a lot of my parents as they are the opposite. Whenever assembling something, my dad likes to follow the instructions closely, while my mom only uses them as a last resort and prefers to look at a fully assembled version of an item in order to figure out how to build it herself. While I haven't looked deep into the studies, I can speak on my personal experiences and say that I feel like I do learn much better in certain styles than others. When simply reading information from a textbook or watching a slow paced documentary on it, I feel like I take away a lot less as opposed to having a discussion or doing a project based around the subjects. I have also heard many others share this sentiment, preferring one style over the other. I found it interesting how the article proved much of this to be false, I certainly thought that the style in which people learned had a substantial effect on comprehension, and it is a topic that I have heard people discuss a lot. It would be interesting to read more into the studies and see exactly how they were conducted and what the full results are. Despite this reading I still have a pretty firm belief that learning styles do have a decent effect.
