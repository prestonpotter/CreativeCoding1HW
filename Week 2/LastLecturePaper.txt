I think that the last lecture was pretty insightful and that Randy Pausch not only offered a lot of advice, and also some entertaining stories from throughout his life. I had three messages that really affected me and stuck with me the most. The first was when Randy was talking about his football coach that was constantly on him and giving him a hard time, and Randy explained how he learned how that is a positive thing, as once people stopped trying so hard to help you it likely means they no longer believe in you. I think this will stick with me as it will make me appreciate criticism and try to embrace more help on things throughout my life from others. The second was some more basic advice, but Randy explained how we should never lose our childlike wonder, and I find that very important. It stood out to me as it related to some writing I had recently done about another class, about how and why we come to understand the world. That curiosity is what gives us purpose to our life, and gives us reason to want to experience new things in hopes of learning more. The final part that stood out to me was when he discussed getting a feedback loop and listening to it. I think this is crucial in any aspect in life that you are trying to learn or get better in. I believe that trial and error is often the best way to learn or improve at something, and if you don’t listen to feedback or acknowledge it, you will never be able to recognize your mistakes and make the needed changes to get yourself closer to your goal. Overall I think this was a very thoughtful lecture by Randy Pausch, as it was not only amazing to see someone so positive and humorous that is in a very rough situation, but also went deeper and offered some great advice while relating it to his own experiences making it feel much more tangible.
