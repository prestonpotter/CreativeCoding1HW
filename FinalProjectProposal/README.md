For my final project I would like to create some sort of simple combat game, something similar to some of the example games I saw, also taking inspiration from the classic space invaders type game, something similiar to that with a snowball fight and adding a bit more to make it unique. I think I want to try to create a basic winter scene, and have snow particles floating across the screen to add to the environment, similar to the fireflies project that I saw in the examples. As for new skills that I will need, I have already figured out how to get my own images into p5.js, and I will need to learn more about collisions and potentially how to make a score. I also will need to learn more about how to make the user control actions for a character for combat. I will try to have my full canvas and elements created in photoshop/illustrator on monday, then work on the code and finish that by friday. For work that I have completed, I have started making the elements that I will import to the project.
